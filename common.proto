// All IDs come in two forms - relative and absolute. Relative IDs are sent only
// by chat backends, while Absolute IDs will only be seen by plugins. A backend
// will only see relative IDs, plugins will only see absolute IDs.
//
// Relative IDs are a string of any characters which can be properly urlencoded.
//
// Absolute IDs are a URL with the following parts representing different
// things:
// - Scheme refers to the backend type (irc, discord, etc)
// - Host refers to the ID of the backend
// - Path refers to the relative ID of this item. Note that this MUST be
//   properly urlencoded as it can contain characters which would cause it to
//   parse differently, such as `#`, often used by the IRC backend to represent
//   channels.
//
// An absolute ID MUST be unique among all items in that set, but they do not
// need to be unique globally.
//
// Note that absolute IDs do not match character-for-character between the
// different backend implementations, but they MUST decode to the same
// components.

// Tags are a set of key-value items which may expose additional information
// about the given Event.
//
// All tags SHOULD be prefixed with something unique to that plugin or backend.
// All tags starting with `seabird-core/` are reserved for use by seabird-core.
//
// Currently known tags:
// - proxy/skip - this can be set to '1' if the message should not be proxied.
//   Any other value means the message should be proxied. As an example, this is
//   useful for metadata which some backends may already provide. Generally if a
//   plugin uses this, it should respond to both normal events and the "send"
//   variant of that message (such as MessageEvent/SendMessageEvent or
//   ActionEvent/PerformActionEvent).
//
// Currently proposed tags:
// - proxy/source-channel-id - set by the proxy plugin if a message is proxied,
//   it will contain the original source channel ID
// - proxy/source-channel-name - set by the proxy plugin if a message is
//   proxied, it will contain the original source channel name
// - proxy/source-user-id - set by the proxy plugin if a message is proxied, it
//   will contain the original source user ID
// - proxy/source-user-name - set by the proxy plugin if a message is proxied,
//   it will contain the original source user name.

// When sent by a chat backend, the ID MAY optionally be used as a hint to the
// frontend to get the same external ID on reconnection. When sent by core to a
// plugin, the ID MUST be an ID pointing to an exact backend instance.
